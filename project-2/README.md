(Java) Hash Table: Implement a hash table (an 1D array of ordered linked list) of B buckets).
  - The bucket size, B, will be enter by user from console.
  - The hash function for the hash table is the “Doit” function
  - The input to program is a text file contains a list of triplets {<op data>} where op is a character either + or - or ?; Where + means insert, means delete, and ? means information retrieval and data is a character string.
  
Input: A text file contains a list of triplets {<op name}  
Outputs: 1) outFile1: Final result of the hash table: from 0 to bucketSize-1, one linked list per text line.  
         2) outFile2: All intermediate outputs, for debugging and to see how program is doing.
