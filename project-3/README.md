(Java) Huffman Coding Part 1: Implement the three steps of the Huffman coding scheme: compute frequency, construct ordered link-list, and construct Huffman binary tree.

Summary of this project:
  1) Opens the input text file and computes the characters counts.
  2) Constructs the Huffman linked list based on the character counts.
  3) Constructs Huffman binary tree from the linked list.
  4) Traverse the Huffman binary tree in
    a) Pre-order
    b) In-order
    c) Post-order
    
Input: A text file containing English language  
Output: 1) outFile1: All outputs the program produces.
