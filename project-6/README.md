(Java) Dijkstra’s Algorithm: Find all paths shortest paths, by using Dijkstra’s algorithm for the Single-Source-Shortest Paths problem N times.

The single-source-shortest pages problem Statement: Given a directed graph, G = <N, E>, and the source node, S, in G, the task is find the shortest paths from S to all other nodes in G, using the Dijkstra’s algorithm.

*** You will be given 2 data files: data1 and data2. data1 is the example given in the lecture note. except using 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 for A, B, C, D, and E; data2 is a larger graph. What to do as follows:
  1) Implement your program based on the specs given below.
  2) Run and debug your program with data1 until your program produces the same result as the lecture note, when source
     node is A.
  3) When the result is correct, then run your program with data2.
  
  Input: 
  - A directed graph, represented by a list of edges with costs, {<ni, nj, c>}
  
  Outputs:
  - SSSfile: for the result of all pairs shortest paths.
  - deBugFile: For all debugging outputs.
