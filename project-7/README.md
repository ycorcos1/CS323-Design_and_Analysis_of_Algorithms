(C++) Prim's MST: Given a connected undirected graph, G, using the Primâ€™s algorithm to construct the Minimum Spanning Tree of G.

Input:
- inFile: A text file contains a connected undirected graph, as a list of edges with costs, <ni, nj, c>. The first text line is the number of nodes in G, follows by a list of triplets, <ni, nj, cost>; ni > 0 and nj > 0.

Outputs:
- MSTfile: The result of Prim's MST in text file format.
- debugFile: For all other outputs.
